A cool bot written by me in discord.py for the Hack Week!

## Software
Python 3.7

discord.py 1.0.0

## Features
This bot is inspired by the Marvel character Thanos, the bot can ban/kick half of the non admin members of your server! After snapping the bot can generate a handy list of the victims and can send a nice thanos quote, and thats pretty much it.

Here's a link to a video of a big snap with 13 people - https://youtu.be/ZjLBeU8d69A?list=UUHYcu88-V1iP1FTTRz_t74A (just keep in mind that this video was made before the list and the quote features were made.)

## How to Use
Invite the bot into your server and give him admin permissions, then insert your token into the token variable and start the program, the bot only has the *!snap* command, you can toggle between kick and ban mode from the JSON file. You can also change the fact that the bot sends a list with the users he snapped and a thanos quote in the JSON file.


### P.S.

This is my first "more than 20 minutes of work" project so don't be harsh ok thanks.

#### P.S. 2
I am completely new to github and at first I made a branch of each day and committed my changes to the branches, then someone told me that I should just commit to master instead so thats what I did, after finishing everything i deleted the old branches to tidy stuff up and then i realized that my old commits and version are gone, but worry not I started at the intended date (:


#Thanks to Discord for hosting the first hacking/programming event I participated in!
