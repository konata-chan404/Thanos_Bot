A cool bot written by me in discord.py for the Hack Week!

## Software
Python 3.7

discord.py 1.0.0

## Features
This bot is was inspired by the Marvel character Thanos, the bot bans/kicks half of the non admin members of the server! It can generate a list of the victims of the bot and can send a nice thanos quote, and thats pretty much it.

Here's a link to a big snap with 13 people - https://youtu.be/ZjLBeU8d69A?list=UUHYcu88-V1iP1FTTRz_t74A (just keep in mind that this video was made before the list and the quote feature were made.)

## How to Use
Insert your token into the token variable and start the program, the bot only has the *!snap* command, you can toggle between kick and ban mode, from the JSON file. You can also change the fact that the bot sends a list with the users he snapped and a thanos quote in the JSON file.


### P.S.

This is my first "more than 20 minutes of work" project so don't be harsh ok thanks.
